The HFO/MDO Bunker Line System has been tested under static pressure of 5.0 bar, which is the 1.5 of the MAWP.
The pressure test has been carried out with HFO Transfer Pump until pressure reached the value of 3.0 Bar, and then continued with a Portable H.P. Pump until the pressure of 5.0 bar has been reached.
( For MDO only!!!  The blind flanges were removed from the By-Pass line between MDO Transfer Pump suction and HFO Transfer Pump suction, and from the LSMGO Storage TK filling line, in order to fill the MDO Bunker Line with MDO by using the HFO Transfer Pump. The Line has been flushed by clean Diesel Oil in order to prevent contamination of the MDO Bunker Line by HFO remains. Dirty MDO has been dumped into HFO Bunker TK (P))
The pressure test has been carried out in sequence to fill up the lines from the lower position and to displace the air from the highest point. All bunker valves have been confirmed closed by responsible officers before pressure test operation commenced.
The following steps were done:

1. The Bunker Line has been filled with HFO/MDO using HFO Transfer Pump by supplying oil from HFO Bunker TK (P)/LSMGO Storage TK (S).
2. All trapped air has been displaced through Bleeder Valve.
3. Bleeder Valve has been closed.
4. The HFO/MDO Bunker Line has been pressurized with HFO Transfer Pump until pressure on the HFO Transfer Pump’s head reaches its nominal value of 3.0 Bar.
5. The HFO Transfer Pump has been stopped.

6. The desired pressure of 5.0 Bar has been reached by operation of the Manual Portable H.P. Pump.
7. The pressure in the HFO/MDO Bunker Line has been monitored for 10 minutes. The HFO/MDO Bunker Line has been constantly monitored for leakages.
8. The filling valve to the HFO Bunker TK (P) has been opened gradually, and the Bunker Line system pressure has been monitored until dropped to Zero.
9. The test pressure/date have been stencilled on the tested pipes
The results of tests were satisfactory. No leakages observed.

PLEASE TAKE ALL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Test Bunker line under static liquid pressure at least 1.5 times the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP)
The pressure test operation will be carried out with the F.O. transfer pump until pressure reaches the nominal value of the pump & will be continues with the help of a portable H.P. pump until the desirable pressure of the 1.5 MAWP
The pressure test operation sequence is to fill up the lines from the lowest position & to displace the air from the highest point. Before pressure test operation commenced all bunker valves should be confirmed closed by responsible officers

STAGE A: PRESSURING THE BUNKER LINE BY THE TRASFER PUMP
1.Fill the bunker line using F.O. transfer pump by supplying oil from respective bunker tank
2.Bleed the trapped air through the bleeder valve until all trapped air has been displaced
3.Close bleeder valve
4.Fit the pressure gauge
5.Open the bleed ball v/v
6.Continue pressurizing the bunker line with transfer pump until pressure on the transfer’s pump head reaches its nominal value
7.Stop the pump

STAGE B: CONTINUE PRESSURIZING BUNKER LINE BY THE H.P. PUMP
8.Turn on the water supply to the test pump
9.Confirm that air pressure on deck has reached the operation pressure of the H.P Pump
10.Start to operate the pump
Pressure will begin building as soon as air flows. When desired test pressure has been met (1.5 times of the MAWP) stop the pump
11.Monitor the pressure in the bunker line for 10 minutes. During the entire operation, monitor the lines for any leakages
If the desired pressure remains steady, proceed as follows:
12.Open gradually the filling v/v to the respective bunker tank & monitor the bunker line system pressure dropping to zero
----
13.Stencil the test pressure/date on the tested pipes
14.Place certificate in vessel’s record
15.Log entries in Deck Logbook and Oil Record Book
16.The date marked must be the same with PMS entry

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please check corresponding manuals that are available in ''Drawings'' section of the Job with additional instructions.

-In order to achieve the maximum battery life span, please proceed as follows:
Storage Charge or discharge the battery to approximately 50% of capacity before storage.
Charge the battery to approximately 50% of capacity at least once every 5 months.
Remove the battery and store it separately from the product.
Store the battery at temperatures between 5 °C and 20 °C.

NOTE: The battery self-discharges during storage.
Higher temperatures (above 20 °C) reduce the battery storage life.

- Shorter battery pack life could occur if the pack is left fully charged, completely discharged, or in an excessive temperature environment (above +45?C) for an extended period of time.
If the battery pack must be left unused for a long time, it must be detached from the transceiver after discharging.
You may use the pack until the remaining capacity is about half, then keep it safely in a cool dry place in the following temperature range:
–20?C to +45?C (within a month)
–20?C to +40?C (within six months)
–20?C to +35?C (within a year)

**JOB RECORDS TO INDICATE CLEARLY THE METHOD USED AND THE OBSERVED CAPACITY **

The capacity of the battery or batteries shall be checked, using an appropriate method, when the ship is alongside at berth.

Verification must take place that the battery can be charged to their capacity within 10hours

There are two alternative methods:
a) Using appropriate battery testing equipment.(In absence of this equipment then follow alternative procedure b)

b) Fully discharge** and recharge the battery, using normal operating current and period (e.g. 10 h). Record the time which is spend for the charging to nominal capacity which cannot be more than 10h. During battery discharging the batteries charger to be switched off (disconnected from GMDSS Batteries)

** Fully discharge means the least voltage a battery can be brought to.
If we discharge the battery below this voltage, the battery can lose its capacity to a level where it cannot be used again.
For Lead Acid batteries this voltage is 1.75V per cell.
So for 24V battery pack (1.75V x 12 Cells), the deep discharge voltage will be 21V.
While performing capacity test, we should never allow the battery voltage to go below 21V or 1.75V/Cell.

- Take oil sample and check contamination in the
   system oil
- Test for water content in the hydraulic oil

 It is of the utmost importance to test the water
 level in the hydraulic oil. Even smaller amount
 may cause the filter element to swell. This will
 increase the filter pressure drop and then the
 filter element is by-passed. This will cause the
 system to operate with no filtration.

Inspect lubrication, greasing, heat generation, noise, looseness of clamping, contact areas of electric equipment, brake, lifting hook & wire-rope
The operator should also perform the inspection, before and after the operation without fail and, if any abnormality is detected while operation, stop the operation immediately to inspect the suspected part.

Wire rope:
Confirm that the wire rope is wound orderly on one layer of the drum

Substitute wire-rope under the following condition:
-When the diameter of the rope has reduced by 7%
-When the number of visible wire fractures is 15 over a length of 6 times the wire-rope diameter, or 30 over a length of 60 times the wire-rope diameter.
-When link caused at some part of the rope does not restore to the original state.
-When the rope is reduced in length partially or is twisted out of shape
-When the rope is deemed unusable because of rust or corrosion

Piping:
During operation, inspect the piping for oil leakage.
Inspection of opening & closing condition of each air exhaust plug, complete close.

Gear casing:
Make sure that the oil quality in the gear casing is in proper level by oil check port attached to the gear casing. (oil bath lubrication).
When the oil level is below the mark, replenish it with lubrication oil.

Hydraulic Motor:
Check whether the working noise, the casing temperature & vibration are normal.
Inspection of working oil temperature, warming up is the operation of hydraulic pump with all control handles at neutral position.

Sheave:
-Check whether flange part of sheave is deformed or broken.
-Check whether the grooved part of sheave is extremely worn away or not. When the grooved part is worn away about 25 % & over of wire rope dia. 4~5 mm, renew it.

Hook:
-Check whether the contact part with rope in the center of hook where the load is hung, is grooved, the open part of hook becomes larger, the material becomes hard and fragile by fatigued hardness and the crack occurs.

- Take oil sample and check contamination in the
   system oil
- Test for water content in the hydraulic oil

 It is of the utmost importance to test the water
 level in the hydraulic oil. Even smaller amount
 may cause the filter element to swell. This will
 increase the filter pressure drop and then the
 filter element is by-passed. This will cause the
 system to operate with no filtration.

Check condition as follows:

1) Check closures on storage bag as well as general condition of bag for ease of removal of suit. Ensure donning instructions are legible. Confirm that suit is the type and size identified on the bag.
2) Lay the suit on a clean, flat surface. Make sure the suit is dry inside and out. Visually check for damage. Rips, tears or punctures should be repaired in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions  by a suitable repair station.
3) Check the zipper by sliding it up and down to check for ease of operation. Using lubricant recommended by the manufacturer, lubricate the front and back of the zipper and the slide fastener. If the zipper is not functional, the suit should be removed from service and discarded or returned to the manufacturer or a suitable repair station.
4) If fitted, check inflatable head support and/or buoyancy ring for damage and ensure that it is properly attached.
Check inflation hose(s) for deterioration. At least quarterly, the head support/buoyancy ring should be inflated and tested for leaks (this test does not apply to integral inflatable lifejackets). Leaks should be repaired in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions by a suitable repair station.
5) Check retro reflective tape for condition and adhesion. Replace if necessary.
6) If fitted, check whistle and expiration date of light and battery.
7) Replace suits in the bag with zippers fully opened.

The opportunity should be taken at such monthly inspections for the crew to practise donning the immersion suits or anti-exposure suits.

Notes:

All immersion suits should be stowed in clearly marked positions.
When cleaning an immersion suit, it should be properly dried prior to re-packing.

After that , turn the piston at BDC and confirm the following ---
 a) The cylinder liner port is not covered by the piston crown
 b) there is no leaks coming from the upper part of the unit (cyl cover, exh. valve , or liner)
 c) liner condition (using mirror)
 d) piston crown top surface (using mirror)

3/ Check the scavenge space cleaning condition. Advise if excessive oil-sludge is found .
Check the flaps of the aux blower.
Check that the drain pipes of the scavenge space are free (every three inspections or at least 3months-- the drain pipes to be cleaned)

3/ Turn the engine so that you can view the piston with all piston rings.
Check the ring tension via a long screwdriver .
Hardness test can be done via a file tail when the rings are in hot condition.
If you try to scratch a ring, there must be scratch observed.

4/ Measure the total clearance between the piston ring and the ring groove and compare the measurements to the clearances data as per maintenance manual.
Record the measurements.

5/ After completion of the scavenge space inspection, the LO pump to be stopped.

6/ Crankcase doors to be opened up and the crankcase to be inspected.

7/ Check if presence of any metal particle in oil is noticed.

For checking the effectiveness of the axial vibration damper, it is necessary to measure the longitudinal movements of the fore end of the crankshaft during running. The vessel is equipped with Electronic Axial Vibration Monitor. The proximeter probe is built on to the lower part of the damper housing and connected to a control unit which displays peak-to peak movements and sends signals to the engine control system. 08.03.2019. During sea passage with 115 rpm of ME the Axial Vibration Monitor showed 0.71 mm reading of peak-to-peak displacement. Normal service value is 0-1.88 mm. Alarm set point is 2.51 mm. Slow down set point is 3.31 mm. 17.03.19. All settings were checked and confirmed. No remarks.

Perform the following visual checks for WMC from inside scavenge space:
-Check the condition of the WMC carefully at each port inspection
-Check for loosen bolts or lamellas
-Check for broken bolts or frames
-In case there are doubts if the WMC is secured properly through the visual inspection from inside scavenge space, remove the covers for through checking in order to assure that the WMCs are intact & that WMC is pressed firmly against the cooler casing & sealing. If the visual inspection from above does not lead to 100% confirmation, we advise to remove the side covers for better inspection. Check all bolts and the position of the WMC using a pry bar to confirm that the WMC is pressed fully against the sealing flange. The bolts must be tightened and the soft hose gasket suppressed to the extent where the distance pieces are pressed fully against the frame in the cooler casing side.

The proper operation of the DSC facilities shall be tested at least once a week by means of a test call with a coast station.
Test calls with nearby vessels, cannot tell us that our equipment is working properly and cannot be used as an evidence for third parties.

MF/HF is not suggested for communication in short distances like few tenths of miles.
For nearby coast stations, it is preferred to use low frequencies.
For distant coast stations, use always high frequencies.
As an example, for distances
up to 1000NM use 2Mhz, (Ground waves, they follow the curvature of the earth and bend)

(Sky waves, they tend to travel in straight lines and reflected by ionosphere)
up to 2000NM use 4-6Mhz,
up to 4000NM use 8-12Mhz
and for up to 8000NM use 12-16Mhz.
Above example is not guaranteed, propagation of MF/HF signals, are dependent by weather, transmission power, condition of our equipment and time.
During night time we achieve longer distances.

In accordance with above instructions, please proceed with test of MF/HF with coast station.
In case of unsuccessful test, please keep testing, with other stations and on other frequencies.
(As far you don’t have an error message in your equipment).

If despite the efforts, contact with a shore station is not feasible, proceed with self-test as per operation manual of your equipment and contact office for further assistance.

Six Monthly Maintenance
1) Scanner:
(a) Turn OFF the main power source before starting maintenance. (b) Set the safety switch for stopping the scanner to cents [OFF],
otherwise an accidental contact with the rotating scanner may result in injury. (c) Radiator:
i. If the radiator front face (radiation plane) is soiled with smoke, salt, dust, paint or bird's droppings, wipe it with a piece of soft cloth wetted with alcohol or water and try to keep it clean at all times.
Otherwise, radar beam may attenuate or reflect on it, resulting in deterioration of radar performance.
ii. Never use solvents of gasoline, benzine, trichloroethylene and ketone
for cleaning. Otherwise, the radiation plane may deteriorate. iii. Check up and clean the radiator.
(d) Scanner Mechanism:
i. Supply Oil Seal: When there is not a grease nipple, the replenishment of grease oil is unnecessary. Remove the cap of the grease nipple on the front of the S band radiator support and supply it with a grease gun. Make the oiling every six months. The oil quantity should be approximately 100 g
that is as much as the grease comes out of the oil seal. Use the grease
of Mobilux 2 of Mobil Oil.

2. Transmitter and Monitor:
The transmitter and monitor, with keyboard, do not require any maintenance. The dust on the monitor screen has been cleaned during weekly maintenance.
3. Electronics Cabinet:
The electronics cabinet requires no maintenance except for the dust filters on the fans.
The air filter pad checked and exchanged due to poor condition.
 4. The Radar Performance condition checked and inspected during operating. No any signs of abnormalities detected. It was confirmed that daily Radar Performance is satisfactory. No remarks.  The Radar Magnetron doesn’t require replacement.

Before commencing any work, switch the radar equipment off at the power distribution board and fix a warning notice which indicates that word is being carried out on the equipment.
Even after switching off, the crt continues to carry a high voltage for some time (about 1 minute).
1. Antenna:
In the antenna gearbox, the v?belt must be checked for wear after every 1000 hours or monthly (approx.) of operation.
2. Transmitter and Monitor:
The transmitter and monitor, with keyboard, do not require any maintenance. If there is dust on the monitor screen, clean the screen with an antistatic cloth.
3. Electronics Cabinet:
The electronics cabinet requires no maintenance except for the dust filters on the fans.
The air filter pad should be checked occasionally, depending on the dustiness of the environment,and should be exchanged if necessary.
4. The Radar Performance condition should be checked and recorded in the job
History. A deteriorated Performance and weak Radar Gain is a strong indication that the Radar Magnetron requires replacement. Boosting the Gain for prolonged period of time due to aged/weakened magnetron is not a good practice. Check running hours of magnetron, compare with estimated life mentioned in Instruction Manual, and request for new Magnetron.

During any maintenance routine, all safety precautions are to be observed most rigidly.

In accordance with maker’s manual please proceed with the below actions:

1.While Main Engine is idle (with turning gear engaged)
-Check the connections and inspect cabling of the shaft earthing device.
-Check grounding assembly for cleanliness.
-Any build-up of oil on the slip-ring face should be removed with degreaser.
-Inspect and clean the brushes and brush holder to prevent blocking with dirt & check condition.
-Inspect the brush copper leads (pig tails) to ensure they have not become loose or corroded. Note brush wear-down and the compression of the hold-down springs on the brushes should be adjusted to ensure good electrical contact.

2.In case the Device is connected to the Alarm system, test the Alarm activation & report in crew comments in which potential (mV) the alarm is activated.

3.While main Engine is running, check the Electrical potential as indicated on the Shaft Earthing Monitoring Panel  & report in crew comments the actual reading.

During Operation:
-Check for proper operation.
Measure heaving speed (m/min): When anchor is a weight from sea bed measure the time needed to heave the anchor between 3rd and 2nd chain shot.

For example: If time is 2 minutes speed is calculated as follows:
27,5 meters/shot divided by 2 minutes results in 13.75 meters / min which is above the specified 9 meters / min, therefore results considered acceptable.
In any case the results must be recorded.
However if speed drops less than 9 meters / min then technical department should be contacted.

In case a wire/rope need to be replaced according to the evaluated condition, office to be advised accordingly

Inspection of  Mooring Wire Ropes, other wires and removal from service

The following should be checked for the purpose of Wire Ropes condition:

- Identify the Wire Rope by its label or permanent marking and consult any previous inspection records
- The nature and number of  broken wires
- Broken wires at the termination
- Localized grouping of wire breaks
- The rate of increase of wire brakes
- The fracture of strands
- Reduction of rope diameter, including that resulting from core deterioration
- Decreased elasticity
- External and internal wear
- External and internal corrosion
- Deformation
- Damage due to heat or electric arcing
- Rate of increase of permanent elongation

Mooring Wires should be replaced basis of the major criteria as following:

1) Visible wire breaks, 2) Wire brakes at termination, 3) Fracture of strands
4) Reduction of rope diameter, 5) Abrasion of outer wires

Inspection of  Mooring Ropes, other ropes and removal from service

The following should be checked for the purpose of  Ropes condition:

- Identify the rope by its label or permanent marking and consult any previous inspection records
- Visually inspect the rope over its entire length identifying any areas require in-depth investigation
- Spliced terminations should also be inspected to ensure they are in as made condition
- Regularly visual check along their length of the rope inspecting regarding:

1) Internal abrasion
2) External abrasion
3) Glossy or glazed areas
4) Inconsistent diameter
5) Discoloration
6) Inconsistencies in texture and stiffness.
7) Other damages

Inspection of Mooring Tails and removal from service

The following should be checked for the purpose of  MooringTails condition:

- Identify the Mooring tail and consult any previous inspection records

- Mooring Tails should be visually inspected over its length identifying external or internal wear and other damages

- Mooring tails should be replaced at least every 18 months unless experience and hours in use coupled with inspection indicates a longer or sorter period is warranted. A record of service should be maintained that includes time in use and inspection results.


Inspection of Mooring Tails Shackles

The following should be checked for the purpose of Tails Shackles condition:

- Identify the Mooring Tail Shackle and consult any previous inspection records.

- Shackle body, bolt or sheave as per applicable type and moving parts securing means to be checked their condition.

- Mooring Tails should be connected to a wire mooring line using appropriate Shackles those manufactured by Mandal, Tonsberg and Boss. The SWL of the joining shackle should be equal to, or grater than, the SWL of the mooring line to which it is attached.

- It is critical that connecting links are rigged in accordance with manufacturers instructions. The eyes of the tails should be protected with suitable sheath, the use of leather sheathing is not recommended.

- If the manufacturer recommends that it is appropriate, a synthetic tail can be attached directly to a high modulus rope by using a cow hitch.

Mast Stays

-The mast stays to be properly greased
-All turnbuckles and moveable parts to be greased and verified workable/moving freely
-The bulldog grips position/installation to be checked and ensure it is as required

The subject equipment is critical.
The maintenance job should be supervised & reported by a senior officer (Captain, C/O, C/E, 2nd Engineer or Electrician, as applicable).
If deactivation of the equipment is necessary, Deactivation Report Form accompanied with Risk Assessment (as per specific RA included in our library) should be submitted to Technical Department.
The maintenance should follow the equipment manual instructions in details.
Reporting of this work should be detailed, including any measurements recorded (as applicable).
If abnormality is noted during the check or overhauling, a corresponding Defect Report should be issued.

Six Monthly Maintenance
1) Scanner:
(a) Turn OFF the main power source before starting maintenance. (b) Set the safety switch for stopping the scanner to cents [OFF],
otherwise an accidental contact with the rotating scanner may result in injury. (c) Radiator:
i. If the radiator front face (radiation plane) is soiled with smoke, salt, dust, paint or bird's droppings, wipe it with a piece of soft cloth wetted with alcohol or water and try to keep it clean at all times.
Otherwise, radar beam may attenuate or reflect on it, resulting in deterioration of radar performance.
ii. Never use solvents of gasoline, benzine, trichloroethylene and ketone
for cleaning. Otherwise, the radiation plane may deteriorate. iii. Check up and clean the radiator.
(d) Scanner Mechanism:
i. Supply Oil Seal: When there is not a grease nipple, the replenishment of grease oil is unnecessary. Remove the cap of the grease nipple on the front of the S band radiator support and supply it with a grease gun. Make the oiling every six months. The oil quantity should be approximately 100 g

In the antenna gearbox, the v?belt must be checked for wear after every 1000 hours or monthly (approx.) of operation.
2. Transmitter and Monitor:
The transmitter and monitor, with keyboard, do not require any maintenance. If there is dust on the monitor screen, clean the screen with an antistatic cloth.
3. Electronics Cabinet:
The electronics cabinet requires no maintenance except for the dust filters on the fans.
The air filter pad should be checked occasionally, depending on the dustiness of the environment,and should be exchanged if necessary.
4. The Radar Performance condition should be checked and recorded in the job
History. A deteriorated Performance and weak Radar Gain is a strong indication that the Radar Magnetron requires replacement. Boosting the Gain for prolonged period of time due to aged/weakened magnetron is not a good practice. Check running hours of magnetron, compare with estimated life mentioned in Instruction Manual, and request for new Magnetron.
